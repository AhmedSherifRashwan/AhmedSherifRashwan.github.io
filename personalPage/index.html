      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>The world is a big and beautiful place, i really like the quote "Photography is the art of making memories tangible." by Destin Sparks and i believe every moment in life must be captured. Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.</p>
      <p>I have had an intrest in photography since i was in my teenage years, i would always love to take photos of the environment and my friends and manipulate light angles to bring out a great photo as an outcome.</p>
      <p>This Photograph was taken by me and edited by myself as well, it was taken at a local park.</p>

      <p>Video editing is an art o its own, being able to sync pictures, clips and creating this great montage in the end is something i find very fun and very relaxing to do, it is a great way to bring pictures and clips to life.</p>
